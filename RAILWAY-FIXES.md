# ðŸ”§ Railway Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Found & Fixed

### âœ… 1. Port Configuration Fixed
**Problem:** `api/main.py` was hardcoded to port 8000
**Fix:** Updated to use `$PORT` environment variable
```python
port = int(os.getenv("PORT", 8000))
uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=port)
```

### âœ… 2. NLTK Data Download Added
**Problem:** NLTK data not available on Railway
**Fix:** Created `railway-start.sh` to download NLTK data on startup
```bash
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords')"
```

### âœ… 3. Startup Script Created
**Problem:** No proper startup sequence
**Fix:** Created `railway-start.sh` and updated `Procfile`
```
web: bash railway-start.sh
```

### âœ… 4. Memory Optimization
**Problem:** Large AI model causing memory issues
**Fix:** Changed default model from `facebook/bart-large-cnn` to `t5-small`
- Smaller model (60MB vs 1.6GB)
- Faster loading
- Less memory usage

## Files Modified

1. **`api/main.py`** - Added PORT environment variable support
2. **`api/summarizer.py`** - Changed default model to t5-small
3. **`Procfile`** - Updated to use startup script
4. **`railway-start.sh`** - Created new startup script
5. **`railway-troubleshooting.md`** - Created troubleshooting guide

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** these changes to GitHub
2. **Redeploy** on Railway
3. **Check logs** for any remaining issues
4. **Test the API** at your Railway URL + `/docs`

## Expected Results

- âœ… Build should succeed
- âœ… App should start properly
- âœ… API should be accessible
- âœ… Model loading should work (with smaller model)
- âœ… NLTK data should be available

## If Still Having Issues

1. **Check Railway logs** for specific error messages
2. **Upgrade Railway plan** if memory issues persist
3. **Consider Hugging Face Spaces** as alternative
4. **Use even smaller model** if needed

## Testing Your Deployment

Once deployed, test these endpoints:
- `GET /` - Basic info
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /models` - Available models
- `POST /upload-pdf` - PDF validation
- `POST /summarize` - Full summarization

Your Railway URL will be something like:
`https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`
